# Water Quality Complaint Department App

## Introduction

This app takes data from NYC OpenData and parses it into a searchable form so users can find water quality complaints within their zip code.

Although this project is still in its early stages, there are still many options to expand and improve its capabilities, including:

* Looping to allow users to search multiple zip codes
* Multiple search parameters so users can search by more than just zip code
* More advanced statistics to find out how your water quality compares to others in your area

Also, please note that this project was completed within a few hours and lighthearted language is used.
